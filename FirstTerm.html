                <h4>⚪ Conclusion about my diagnostic assessment</h4>
                <p>After my diagnostic assessment, I realized that my receptive skills are stronger than my 
                    productive skills. I can understand written texts and identify the general context even if 
                    I do not know some words. When I listen to English, I can understand it if the speaker 
                    talks clearly and not too fast. However, I noticed that I still have difficulties when I 
                    write and speak.</p>
                <h4>⚪ identification of weaknesses.</h4>
                <p>My main weaknesses are writing and speaking. When I write, I sometimes have problems 
                    organizing sentences correctly and using the correct verb tenses. I also make grammatical 
                    mistakes.<br>
                    When I speak, I feel nervous and sometimes I freeze or forget words. I know what I want to 
                    say, but I do not always know how to express it correctly in English.</p>
                <h4>⚪ identification of strengths.</h4>
                <p>One of my strengths is reading comprehension. I can understand the main idea of a text even 
                    if I do not know every word. I also have good listening comprehension when the English is 
                    clear and not too fast.<br>Another strength is that I am motivated and willing to improve 
                    my English skills.</p>
                <h4>⚪ Learning objective for this semester</h4>
                <p>My learning objective for this semester is to improve my speaking confidence and writing 
                    structure. I want to organize my ideas better, reduce grammatical mistakes, and speak more 
                    fluently without feeling nervous. By the end of the semester, I want to communicate my 
                    ideas more clearly and naturally.</p>
